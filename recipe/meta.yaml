  summary: A framework for elegantly configuring complex applications
  description: |
    Hydra is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the development of research and other complex
    applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a hierarchical configuration by composition and
    override it through config files and the command line. The name Hydra comes from its ability to run multiple
    similar jobs - much like a Hydra with multiple heads.
